### Tips: ###

* [X] Take the time to generate and store strong[er] passwords for your accounts: 
     * **Test the strength of your current passwords** by using the [Bitwarden Password Strength Testing Tool](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/).
   * A [strong password](https://restoreprivacy.com/strong-password/) should contain a minimum of 12-14 characters and a mix of special characters, numbers, and uppercase and lowercase letters. You can use [Bitwarden Password Generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/) to create strong passwords. Note: Bitwarden Password Generator and Bitwarden 2FA Autenticator are both conveniently incorporated into Bitwarden Password Manager.
* [X] Desktop and mobile app privacy and security:
   * Use the [United States 2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory/us/) to find out if your desktop and mobile apps offer [Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://bitwarden.com/blog/basics-of-two-factor-authentication-with-bitwarden/). At a minimum, consider enabling 2FA for banking apps and any other high-importance services. **Remember:** it only takes a of couple extra seconds to sign in with 2FA.
   * Within each apps Privacy Preferences, consider opting out of any optional data collection and sharing. If a service does not offer such options, consider discontinuing the service due to a lack of respect for user autonomy.
* [X] Web browsing protection:
   * [Click here](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) to test your web browsers current protection against web tracking.
   * Optimize your Privacy and Security settings. For example, [here is FireFox guide to optimal privacy settings](https://restoreprivacy.com/firefox-privacy/).
   * Install [web browser extensions](https://www.howtogeek.com/718676/what-is-a-browser-extension/) that have a mission to maintain your digital privacy and security -- [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) (by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org)).
